<h1>Why Thrum Exists</h1>
<p>AI coding agents are genuinely productive. A single agent can implement a<br>feature, write tests, and commit working code faster than most developers type.<br>Run several in parallel across worktrees and you can move through an entire<br>backlog in an afternoon.</p>
<p>Most multi-agent tools are trying to solve a different problem than Thrum. They<br>want full autonomy — you give the agents a goal, they figure out the plan, they<br>ship code, you review it later. That&#39;s fine for some work. It&#39;s not what I built<br>Thrum for.</p>
<p>Thrum is for when you want the speed of multiple agents but you still want to<br>understand what they built. You do the thinking. The agents do the typing.</p>
<h2>Two Approaches to Working with AI Agents</h2>
<p>There are two ways people work with AI agents.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous orchestration.</strong> You describe a goal, the system breaks it into<br>tasks, assigns agents, and delivers results. You set objectives and review<br>outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Human-directed work.</strong> You do the research. You make the decisions. You write<br>the instructions. Agents execute your plan on separate branches. You review the<br>code, run the tests, and merge.</p>
<p>Thrum is for the second approach. It doesn&#39;t assign tasks or plan work. It gives<br>agents a way to message each other across worktrees and machines, so you can run<br>several in parallel without being the message relay yourself.</p>
<h2>The Workflow</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s what a typical day looks like when using Thrum with a tool like Beads for<br>issue tracking:</p>
<p><strong>1. Research.</strong> You work with an agent to research a problem or feature. The<br>agent does all the boring heavy lifting — reading through the codebase, tracing<br>dependencies, understanding the current state of things — and comes back to you<br>with a proposed solution. You can chat about it, ask questions, and make changes<br>until you like it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Plan.</strong> You ask the agent to investigate the codebase, docs, or whatever<br>needs changing. It does the boring detailed slog of finding all the<br>dependencies, figuring out what will break, and adding that to the plan.<br>Rewriting the docs to fit the new code, etc. Then it gives you a spec that you<br>can read and understand and approve or change as you see fit.</p>
<p><strong>3. Document.</strong> Now you have an agreed-on plan so you tell the agent to break<br>it down into idempotent steps, optimized for making it very organized and<br>parallelizable where possible. Then it uses the Beads issue tracker to create<br>Epics and Tasks which are the full record of what to do. Then the agent writes a<br>prompt file which you give to a different agent to implement. It has all the<br>details needed — the spec is referenced, the Epics and Tasks are talked about,<br>it has directions on how you like it to execute (use sub-agents, make sure test<br>coverage is 80%, run all tests, code review when you are done, etc.). Now you<br>can read this if you like, or don&#39;t trust the agent yet, and you can see exactly<br>what is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>4. Implement.</strong> You hand that prompt to an agent on a worktree. It claims<br>tasks, writes code, runs tests, commits. Thrum lets you see what it&#39;s doing<br>(<code>thrum team</code>, <code>thrum who-has</code>). If you&#39;re running multiple agents on different<br>features, Thrum lets them message each other and stay coordinated without you<br>relaying information manually.</p>
<p><strong>5. Review and merge.</strong> Now the code is written and the tests pass and the work<br>is isolated in a worktree on a branch. You ask your coordinator agent — probably<br>the one you worked with to research and write the spec and the prompt — to do a<br>code review against the spec and deal with any findings. It tells you what it<br>found and usually asks if you want it to fix them. When you are satisfied, you<br>tell it to merge and you are done.</p>
<p>This cycle repeats. Research, plan, document, implement, review. You get the<br>speed of parallel agents with the confidence of understanding every change.</p>
<p>The prompts you write are documentation. The issues you create are your audit<br>trail. The git history shows exactly what happened. Nothing is hidden.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Feel Different</h2>
<p>When you work this way, it still feels like you wrote the code. The agent was<br>faster than you typing, but the decisions were yours. Six months later when<br>something breaks, you remember why it works this way — because you approved the<br>plan before the code got written.</p>
<h2>Inspectable by Design</h2>
<p>No magic. Everything in Thrum is just files you can look at.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> are JSONL files on a Git branch. They&#39;re just text — <code>cat</code> them,<br><code>grep</code> them, pipe them through <code>jq</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Agent identity</strong> is a JSON file in <code>.thrum/identities/</code>. Open it with any<br>text editor.</li>
<li><strong>Sync</strong> is Git push and pull. Run <code>git log</code> on the <code>a-sync</code> branch to see<br>exactly what synced and when.</li>
<li><strong>State</strong> is a SQLite database rebuilt from the JSONL source of truth. Query<br>it directly, or delete it — it rebuilds.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s no cloud service, no opaque API. If something goes wrong, you look at<br>files.</p>
<h2>What Thrum Is Not</h2>
<p>Thrum doesn&#39;t plan your work - it makes planning your work easier and faster.</p>
<p>It won&#39;t break everything down and make all the decisions for you unless you<br>tell it to. You do that with the help of your agents and you can see what is<br>going to happen before it happens - not after the damage is done.</p>
<p>Thrum doesn&#39;t orchestrate your agents. It gives agents a way to message each<br>other across worktrees and machines, so you can run several in parallel without<br>being the message relay yourself.</p>
<p>Thrum doesn&#39;t stop agents or interrupt their work. If you need to stop an agent,<br>you stop the process. Thrum provides the communication layer — you provide the<br>control.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a framework either. Any agent that can run shell commands or use MCP<br>tools can use Thrum. There&#39;s no SDK to integrate, no protocol to implement<br>beyond basic messaging.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s not trying to replace you. You&#39;re the one who understands the codebase.<br>Thrum just makes it practical to direct multiple agents at once. And the process<br>keeps you in the loop as much as you want. Transparent and auditable. You are in<br>control.</p>
<h2>For Working Developers</h2>
<p>I built Thrum for myself — someone who ships production code and needs to<br>understand the codebase they&#39;re working in. Not for AI researchers building<br>novel agent architectures. Not for platform teams building orchestration<br>systems.</p>
<p>If you want agents to autonomously tackle your backlog while you do something<br>else, there are good tools for that. If you want to direct the work yourself and<br>have agents execute faster than you can type, that&#39;s what Thrum is for.</p>
