description: Combined status, team, and inbox view
---

Show a combined view of agent status, active team members, and inbox messages.

```bash
thrum overview               # Human-readable
thrum overview --json        # Machine-readable
```

This is equivalent to running `thrum status`, `thrum team`, and `thrum inbox`
together.
