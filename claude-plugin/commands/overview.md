description: Combines identity, team, inbox, and sync status
---

Show a combined view of agent identity, active team members, inbox messages, and sync status.

```bash
thrum overview               # Human-readable
thrum overview --json        # Machine-readable
```

This is equivalent to running `thrum status`, `thrum team`, `thrum inbox`, and
`thrum sync status` together.
